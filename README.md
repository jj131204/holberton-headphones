# holberton-headphones

 In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

#Here the final result:

<img alt="holberton-headphones"  src="https://github.com/jj131204/holberton-headphones/blob/main/images/holberton-headphones.jpg" />
